      <h2 class="bounce">Drone Delivery</h2>
      Drone delivery is a technology that uses unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to transport goods from one place to another. Drone delivery has many benefits, such as speed, convenience, efficiency, and environmental friendliness. However, it also faces many challenges, such as safety, regulation, logistics, and public acceptance. Drone delivery is still a developing technology that needs to overcome these obstacles before it can become widely adopted.

      <h2 class="bounce">Tech in healthcare</h2>
      Modern technology has transformed the way hospitals deliver healthcare services to patients. Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems store and share patient data across different departments and locations, enabling remote consultations and diagnoses. Telehealth platforms allow doctors to reach out to patients in rural or remote areas through video calls, mobile apps, and wearable devices. Bedside computer terminals give patients access to their own medical records, as well as communication and service options. Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) solutions help hospitals manage their communications with patients, staff, and other stakeholders through cloud-based platforms. These technologies improve the quality, efficiency, and accessibility of healthcare services.

      <h2 class="bounce">Virtual Reality</h2>
      Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that allows users to experience immersive and interactive digital environments. VR has been developed since the 1960s, but it became more popular and accessible in the 2010s with the emergence of consumer devices like Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and PlayStation VR. The metaverse is a concept that describes a shared virtual space that combines VR, augmented reality (AR), and the internet. The term was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel Snow Crash. The metaverse is still in development, but many tech companies like Meta (formerly Facebook), Microsoft, and Apple are working on creating it.

      <h2 class="bounce">Tech in education</h2>
      Modern technology in education is the use of new tools and methods that enhance teaching and learning. The cloud, video streaming, augmented reality, learning simulations, virtual reality, blockchain, and machine learning are some examples of modern technology in education. These technologies allow teachers and students to access, store, and share information online, watch and create videos, overlay digital information on the real world, simulate realistic scenarios and environments, transport to different places and times, store and verify educational records and credentials, and analyze data and provide personalized feedback and recommendations. These technologies improve the quality, effectiveness, and accessibility of education.    </div>
